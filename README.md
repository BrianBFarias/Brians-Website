# Getting Started with Create React App Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/create-react-app).

 [Website](https://brianfarias.info)

## Getting start

First open up your terminal and paste the following command, replacing "ExampleName" with your desired program name
```
npx create-react-app "ExampleName"
```

This will create a template for you to get started on your website. Running the command below will open VS code (if you have that setup as your main editor)

```
cd "ExampleName"
code .
```

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
